Introduction
------------

This bundle is for Symfony2.

It will make a perfect transport gateway for Postfix, if you for instance want to make a web interface for a Antispam / Antivirus gateway.

There is an example config in Resources/docs/postfix for how to set postfix up to fit this bundle.


CLI examples
------------

If you dont want to use the webinterface you can just as well use the CLI.

php app/console pf:transport --domain=hollo.dk --transport smtp:mail.hollo.dk


Symfony2 Deps
-------------

Make Symfony2 take care of this bundle simply by adding it to your deps file in the root folder.

[HolloPostfixBundle]
  git=http://github.com/hollodk/HolloPostfixBundle.git
  target=/bundles/Hollo/PostfixBundle

Now add the bundle to the AppKernel and autoload file as usual the symfony2 way.

Upgrade by simple executing ./bin/vendors install, thats exactly the same way as you upgrade your symfony installation.
